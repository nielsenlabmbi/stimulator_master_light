# Notes on stimulator code for visual stimulus generation

# Setup components
## Master:
- Windows or Ubuntu machine
- Matlab
- No specific requirements for graphics card or monitor
- Can be running acquisition as well (depending on demands of acquisition)

## Slave:
- Ubuntu
- Matlab
- Psychtoolbox-compatible graphics card (most recently, weâ€™ve used NVidia Geforce GTX 1050)  
  Notes on configuration for NVidia graphics card for Psychtoolbox:  
    - Make sure graphics card is set to optimal power setting (using power mizer interface for NVidia driver)  
    - Disable dithering
- 2 screens suitable for visual stimulus display, set up in mirroring mode (i.e. not extended desktop)
- Psychtoolbox  
  Need to ensure that Psychtoolbox can run without dropping frames by running Psychtoolbox test scripts (in particular, VBLSyncTest)
- If stimulus triggers are required: USB-1208FS from Measurement Computing  
  Note that USB-1208FS-Plus is not compatible with Psychtoolbox


# Initial setup

- Ensure that master and slave can communicate via TCP (use ping to test); may have to adjust firewall settings
- Copy correct part of stimulator code onto each machine
- On the master, generate the following directories:  
  - analyzer root directory  
  - directory for history files  
  - params & looper file - on windows expected to be c:\params looper
